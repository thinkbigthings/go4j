	// Go's arrays are values.
	// An array variable denotes the entire array; it is not a pointer to the first array element.
	// This means that when you assign or pass around an array value you will make a copy of its contents.
	// (To avoid the copy you could pass a pointer to the array, but then thatâ€™s a pointer to an array, not an array.)
	// One way to think about arrays is as a sort of struct but with indexed rather than named fields:
	// a fixed-size composite value.

	// An array's size is fixed; its length is part of its type ([4]int and [5]int are distinct, incompatible types)
